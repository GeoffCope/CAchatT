# KAchatT
Komputer Algebra Chat.  Allows your kindergartener to solve the Einstein Field Equations faster than it takes to write a b.s. college application using outdated large language AI.
Current technology allows one to launch 96 threads in the Gravitational_Wave repository and solve all 700 notebooks.  One of the major complaints about large language models is that they're not really search.  However, the original search model was based on academic citations.   Since all of the notebooks include those citations, one should be able to chat and search.
Completion of KAchatT is dependent on the following:  LDS-3 (Lucid Dream Simulator 3 Neophyte Edition) and the LDS-4 (Low Diving Snoopy IV)
The Lucid Dream Simulator 3 Neophytes Edition should not be confused with the LDS-3 NeoFights which were already featured in The Matrix.
For information concerning LDS-1 and LDS-2 please see:

Don't worry helium, we're coming for you.  Too bad that's in California, probably have to move. Sigh.

Seriously, you'd think Utah would have figured it out by now as to why stuff *might* get invented here, and then commercialized literally anywhere else.  Utah has a long history of driving people away so they can find a better culture and work environment.  Utah has a better chance of fixing their air quality and water supply before they fix their culture.  See last paragarph for XEROX PARC
