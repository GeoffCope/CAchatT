# CAchatT
Computer Algebra Chat.  Allows your kindergartener to solve the Einstein Field Equations faster than it takes to write a b.s. college application using outdated large language AI.
Current technology allows one to launch 96 threads in the Gravitational_Wave repository and solve all 700 notebooks.  One of the major complaints about large language models is that they're not really search.  However, the original search model was based on academic citations.   Since all of the notebooks include those citations, one should be able to chat and search.
Completion of CAchatT is dependent on the following:  LDS-3 (Lucid Dream Simulator 3 Neophyte Edition) and the LDS-4 (Low Diving Snoopy IV)
